Quiz 3 Set Theory

Q1. **Two** six-sided dice (六面骰子) are thrown sequentially, and the **face values** that come up are recorded. (i.e. the element is of the form: $(1,6)$, means the first throw is $1$, and the second throw is $6$.)

(a) List the universal set $\Omega$.

(b) List the elements that make up the following cases:

  1. $A$ = the sum of the two values is at least $5$;

  2. $B$ = the value for the ﬁrst die is higher than the value of the second;

  3. $C$ = the ﬁrst value is $4$.

(c) List the elements of the following cases:

  1. $A\cap C$;

  2. $B\cup C$;

  3. $A\cap (B\cup C)$.

  4. $(A\backslash C)\cup B$.

  5. $(A\cap (B\cup C))^c$.

  6. $(A^c\cup B^c)\cap(A^c\cup C^c)$.

  7. Is $\{(1,2),(1,3),(1,4)\}$ a subset of $A$?

  8. $C \subset A$ ? $B\subset A$ ?
