## Ring

### Examples

1. `Trivial Rings`: Take $R$ be any commutative group, define multipication by $a\times b=0$ for all $a,b\in R$. If $R=\{0\}$, trivial group, we call it `zero ring`, denoted $R=0$.

2. `Integers` $\Z$: Identity $1$ for addition and multiplication. Note that $\Z - \{0\}$ under multiplication is not a group.

3. `Rational Numbers` $\mathbb Q$, `Real Numbers` $\mathbb R$, `Complex Numbers` $\mathbb C$: Identity: $0$ for addition, $1$ for multiplication.

4. `Quotient Group` $\Z / n\Z$: Identity $\bar 1$ for addition and multiplication of residue classes.

5. `The (real) Hamilton Quaternions` (The first discovered noncommutative ring, 1843 by Sir William Rowan Hamilton). Let $\mathbb H$ be the collection of elements of the form $a+bi+cj+dk$ where $a,b,c,d\in \R$ are real numbers (loosely, "polynomials in $1,i,j,k$ with real coefficients") where addition is defined "componentwise" by 
  $$
(a+bi+cj+dk)+(a^\prime+b^\prime i+c^\prime j+d^\prime k) \\= (a+a^\prime)+(b+b^\prime) i+(c+c^\prime) j+(d+d^\prime)k
$$
and multiplication is defined by expanding $(a+bi+cj+dk)(a^\prime+b^\prime i+c^\prime j+d^\prime k)$ using distributive law, and simplifying using the relations
$$
i^2=j^2=k^2=-1,\quad ij=-ji=k,\\jk=-kj=i,\quad ki=-ik=j
$$

6. `Functions`: Let $X$ be any nonempty set and let $A$ be any ring. The collection, $R$, of all (set) functions $f:X\to A$ is a ring under the usual definition of pointwise addition and multiplication of functions: $(f+g)(x)=f(x)+g(x)$ and $(fg)(x)=f(x)g(x)$.

7. `Non-Identity` $2\Z$.

### Proposition 1

Let $R$ be a ring, then

1. $0a=a0=0$
2. $(-a)b=a(-b)=-(ab)$
3. (-a)(-b)=ab$
4. if $R$ has identity $1$, then the identity is unique, and $-a=(-1)a$.

### Def

1. A nonzero element $a\in R$ is called a `zero divisor` if there is a nonzero element $b\in R$ s.t. either $ab=0$ or $ba=0$.
2. Assume $R$ has an identity $1\neq 0$. An element $u\in R$ is called a unit in $R$ if there is some $v\in R$ s.t. $uv=vu=1$. The set of units in $R$ is denoted $R^\times$.

Observe: A zero divisor can never be a unit.

### Examples

1. $\Z$ has no zero divisors, and its only units are $\pm 1$, i.e., $\Z^\times = \{\pm 1\}$.

2. $\Z/n\Z$, $n\geq 2$. The elements $\bar u$ for which $u$ and $n$ are relatively prime are units. On the other hand, $a$ is no relatively prime to $n$ then $\bar a$ is zero divisor in $\Z/n\Z$. Hence every nonzero element of $\Z/n\Z$ is either a unit or a zero divisor.
