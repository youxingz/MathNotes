# Rings of Fractions

### Theorem

Let $R$ be a commutative ring, $D=R^\times$. Then there is a commutative ring $Q$ with $1$ s.t. $Q\supset R$ as a subring and every element of $D$ is a unit in $Q$. The ring $Q$ has following additional properties:

1. every element of $Q$ is of the form $rd^{-1}$ for some $r\in R$, $d\in D$. In particular, if $D=R-\{0\}$, then $Q$ is a field.
2. (uniqueness of $Q$) The ring $Q$ is the `smallest` ring containing $R$ in which all elements of $D$ become units, in the following sense. Let $S$ be any commutative ring with identity and let $\varphi: R\to S$ be any injective ring homomorphism s.t. $\varphi(d)$ is a unit in $S$ for every $d\in D$. Then there is an injective homomorphism $\Phi: Q\to S$ s.t. $\Phi |_R = \varphi$. In other words, any ring containing an isomorphic copy of $R$ in which all the elements of $D$ become units must also contain an isomorphic copy of $Q$.

### Def. [Fractions]

Let $R,D,Q$ be as above.

1. The ring $Q$ is called the `ring of fractions` of $D$ with respect to $R$ and is denoted $Q:=D^{-1}R$.
2. If $R$ is an integral domain and $D=R-\{0\}$, $Q$ is called the `field of fractions` or `quotient field` of $R$.

If $A$ is a subset of a field $F$, then the intersection of all the subsets of $F$ containing $A$ is a subfield of $F$ and is called the subfield `generated` by $A$. This subfield is the smallest subfield of $F$ containing $A$.

### Corollary [生成和分式的同构性]

Let $R$ be an integral domain and let $Q$ be the field of fractions of $R$. If a field $F$ contains a subring $R^\prime$ isomorphic to $R$ then the subfield of $F$ generated by $R^\prime$ is isomorphic to $Q$. ($F\supseteq R^\prime \cong R \implies (R^\prime)\cong Q=(R-\{0\})^{-1}R$)

Proof. Let $\varphi: R\cong R^\prime \subseteq F$ be a (ring) homomorphism of $R\to R^\prime$.  In particular, $\varphi: R\to F$ is an injective homomorphism from $R$ into the field $F$. Let $\Phi: Q\to F$ be the extension of $\varphi$, hence $\Phi$ is injective, so $\Phi(Q)$ is an isomorphic copy of $Q$ in $F$ containing $\varphi(R)=R^\prime$. Now, any subfield of $F$ containing $R^\prime = \varphi(R)$ contains the elements $\varphi(r_1)\varphi(r_2)^{-1}=\varphi(r_1r_2^{-1})$ for all $r_1,r_2\in R$. Since every element of $Q$ is of the form $r_1r_2^{-1}$, it follows that any subfield of $F$ containing $R^\prime$ contains the field $\Phi(Q)$, so that $\Phi(Q)$ is the subfield of $F$ generated by $R^\prime$.

### Examples
1. If $R$ is a field then its field of fractions is just $R$ itself.
2. The integers $\Z$ are an integral domain whose field of fractions is the field $\mathbb Q$ of rational numbers. The quadratic integer ring $O$ is an integral domain whose field of fractions is the quadratic field $\mathbb Q(\sqrt D)$.
3. The subring $2\Z$ of $\Z$ also has no zero divisors. Its field of fractions is also $\mathbb Q$.
4. If $R$ is any integral domain, then the polynomial ring $R[x]$ is also an integral domain. The elements of this fraction field are of the form $\dfrac{p(x)}{q(x)}$, where $q(x)\neq0$. In particular, $p,q$ may both be constant polynomials, so the field of rational functions contains the field of fractions of $R$. If $F$ is a field, we shall denote the field of rational functions by $F(x)$. Thus if $F$ is the field of fractions of the integral domain $R$ then the field of rational functions over $R$ is the same as the field of rational functions over $F$, namely $F(x)$.

    For example, suppose $R=\Z$, so $F=\mathbb Q$. If $p(x),q(x)$ are polynomials in $\mathbb Q[x]$ then for some integer $N, Np(x), Nq(x)$ have integer coefficients. Then $\dfrac{p(x)}{q(x)}=\dfrac{Np(x)}{Nq(x)}$ can be written as the quotient of two polynomials with integer coefficients, so the field of fractions of $\mathbb Q[x]$ is the same as the field of fractions of $\Z[x]$.
5. If $R$ is any commutative ring with $1$, and $d$ is neither zero nor a zero divisor in $R$. We may form the ring $R[1/d]$ by setting $D=\{1,d,d^2,d^3,...\}$ and defining $R[1/d]$ to be the ring of fractions $D^{-1}R$. Note that $R$ is the subring of elements of the form $r/1$. In this way any nonzero element of $R$ that is not a zero divisor can be inverted in a larger ring containing $R$...
